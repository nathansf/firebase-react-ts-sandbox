## Simple React/Typescript app/sandbox to reinforce some areas I've learned through Udemy courses

- Set up React router with basic config
- Debounce util demo'ed in an input field
- Component to embed Github code on a page for quick reference

### Notes

- Currently desktop only, not sure if I'll get around to making a mobile nav
